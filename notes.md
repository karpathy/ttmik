# TTMIK Level 2

Follows TTMIK (https://talktomeinkorean.com/curriculum/level-2-korean-grammar/).

## Lesson 1

To make sentence future tense add -(으)ㄹ 거예요 .
Determining whether to use -ㄹ 거예요 or -을 거예요:
- Verb stems ending with a vowel (보다, 가다, 자다) are followed by -ㄹ 거예요.
- Verb stems ending with a consonant (먹다, 찾다, 붙다) are followed by -을 거예요.
- Exception: Verb stems already ending with ㄹ (놀다, 멀다, 살다) are followed only by 거예요.

지금 갈 거예요. = I am going to go (there) now.
내일 갈 거예요. = I am going to go tomorrow.
뭐 할 거예요? = What are you going to do?
이거 정말 할 거예요? = Are you really going to do it?
입다 = to wear
뭐 입을 거예요? = What are you going to wear?
누구 만날 거예요? = Who are you going to meet?
어디에서 만날 거예요? = Where are you going to meet?
언제 만날 거예요? = When are you going to meet?
얼마에 팔 거예요? = At what price are you going to sell it?

밥 언제 먹을 거예요? = When are you going to eat?
지금 먹을 거예요. = I am going to eat now.
어디에서 먹을 거예요? = Where are you going to eat?

아니요. 지금 갈 거예요. = No. I am going to go now.

## Lesson 2

Previously:
- topic marking particles (-은, -는)
- subject marking particles (-이, -가)

Now: Object-marking Particles / -을, -를
-을 - used after a noun ending in a consonant
-를 - used after a noun ending in a vowel
To explain it simply, they help listeners/readers predict the verb (to an extent).

사과를 먹었어요? = Did you eat an apple?
사과를 사요? = Are you buying an apple?
Q: Why not -ing format? (Present Progressive)

By adding -가 (subject marking particle) to 사과, 
it becomes the SUBJECT of the sentence,
meaning that the verb will be ABOUT the 사과

Sometimes these can be dropped, e.g.:
사과를 사요? → 사과 사요? (Are you buying an apple?)
이 사과가 맛있어요. → 이 사과 맛있어요. (This apple is delicious.)
The meaning of these sentences stays the same with or without a particle.

:O??
어제 누구를 여기에서 만났어요? = WHO did you meet here yesterday?

텔레비전 자주 봐요? = Do you watch TV often?

## Lesson 3

And, and then, therefore, so / 그리고, 그래서

1: 그리고 has the meaning of “and” or “and then” depending on the context

빵 = bread
커피, 빵, 그리고 물 = coffee, bread and water
서울 그리고 부산 = Seoul and Busan
친구를 만났어요. 그리고 밥을 먹었어요. = I met my friend. And then I ate.

2: 그래서 has the meaning of “therefore” and “so”, and just as in English, using this word between two sentences shows a logical relation between sentences.

비가 오다 = to rain
오늘은 비가 왔어요. 그래서 집에 있었어요. = It rained today. So I stayed home.

음식 = food
김치는 맛있어요. 그리고 한국 음식이에요. = Kimchi is delicious. And it is Korean food.
저는 학생이에요. 그래서 돈이 없어요. = I am a student. So I don't have money.

## Lesson 4

-하고 = and

이거하고 이거 주세요. = Give me this and this.

-(이)랑 = and

하고 can be used both formal and informal 랑 is more casual.

If noun ends in a vowel: -랑 
If noun ends with a consonant: -이랑 

우유랑 빵 = milk and bread
빵이랑 우유 = bread and milk
우유랑 빵 샀어요. = I bought milk and bread.

both -하고 and -(이)랑 can also mean “with”. This is disambiguated based on context alone.

친구하고 영화 봤어요. - I saw a movie with a friend.
누구랑 갔어요? - Who did you go with?

To make this even clearer, add 같이 after either, meaning "together with", so:

친구하고 같이 영화 봤어요. = I saw a movie with a friend.
누구랑 같이 갔어요? = Who did you go with?

More samples:

동생 = younger sibling
공부하다 = to study
동생하고 공부할 거예요. = I am going to study with my younger sibling.
선생님 = teacher
선생님하고 밥을 먹을 거예요. = I am going to eat with my teacher.
내일 선생님하고 경복궁에 갈 거예요. = I am going to go to Gyeongbok Palace with my teacher tomorrow.
어제 홍대하고 신촌에 갔어요. = I went to Hongdae and Sinchon yesterday.

## Lesson 5

The syllable 요 and 일 together mean “day of the week”.

Monday = 월요일
Tuesday = 화요일
Wednesday = 수요일
Thursday = 목요일
Friday = 금요일
Saturday = 토요일
Sunday = 일요일

저는 월요일에 영화를 봤어요. = I watched a movie on Monday.

## Lesson 6

그렇지만 - but, however
그런데 - but, however

Nuance:
- To introduce two actions or states which occurred one after another, and if the first
sentence is background information for the second, only use 그런데.
- 그런데 can be used for a wider variety of meanings
- 그렇지만 has a very formal nuance to it and is used more in writing
- in every day conversations, 그런데 is used more often than 그렇지만.

Examples:

피곤해요. 그렇지만 영화 보고 싶어요. = I am tired, but I want to see a movie.
피곤해요. 그런데 영화 보고 싶어요. = I am tired. However, I want to see a movie.

어제 학교에 갔어요. 그렇지만 일요일이었어요. = I went to school yesterday, but it was Sunday.

늦게 = late, at a late hour
피곤하다 = to be tired
어젯밤 늦게 잤어요. 그런데 피곤하지 않아요. = I went to bed late last night, but I am not tired.

매일 = every day
살이 빠지다 = to lose weight
저는 매일 운동을 해요. 그런데 살이 빠지지 않아요. = I work out every day, but I do not lose any weight.

왕따 = outcast, loner, someone who is bullied by others
저는 친구가 없어요. 그런데 왕따는 아니에요. = I do not have friends, but I am not a loner.

## Lesson 7

-한테 - “to” someone, “from” someone
-한테서 - “from” someone

저한테 = to me, from me
친구한테 = to a friend, from a friend
누구한테 = to whom, from whom
저한테서 = from me
친구한테서 = from a friend
누구한테서 = from whom

## Lesson 8

Telling the time

When saying the hour, use native Korean numbers (1, 2, 3 and 4 change a bit!)
(native Korean) Number + 시 - hour
한 시 = 1 o’clock (not 하나 시)
두 시 = 2 o’clock (not 둘 시)
세 시 = 3 o’clock (not 셋 시)
네 시 = 4 o’clock (not 넷 시)
다섯 시 = 5 o’clock
여섯 시 = 6 o’clock
일곱 시 = 7 o’clock
...

여섯시 정각에 만나요 = Let’s meet at 6 o’clock sharp.

When saying minutes use sino-Korean numbers.
Number + 분 [bun] = minute
일 분 = 1 minute
이 분 = 2 minutes
십 오 분 [si-bo bun] = 15 minutes
삼십 분 [sam-sip bun] = 30 minutes
오십오 분 [o-si-bo bun] = 55 minutes

Examples:
1:05 = 한 시 오 분
1:15 = 한 시 십오 분
3:20 = 세 시 이십 분
10:00 = 열 시
10:30 = 열 시 삼십 분

지금 몇 시예요? = What time is it now?

매일 = every day
출근하다 [chul-geun-ha-da] = to go to work
저는 매일 아침 9시까지 출근해요. = I get to work by 9 every morning.

내일 = tomorrow
수업 = class
끝나다 = to finish
내일 수업이 네시 반에 끝나요. = My classes finish at 4:30 tomorrow.

오늘 몇 시에 친구를 만나요? = What time do you meet your friend today?

오늘 몇 시에 출근했어요? = What time did you come to work today?
아홉 시 반에 출근했어요. 유정 씨는요? = I came to work at 9:30. How about you, Yujeong?
여덟 시 십 분에 출근했어요. = I came to work at 8:10.

## Lesson 9

Counters

Korean: noun + number + counter
1. “car” + one + “counter for cars”
2. “pencil” + two + “counter for pencils”
3. “book” + three + “counter for books”

The majority of the time, counters are used with native Korean numbers.

There are many counters, for this lesson we just do 개 and 명.
- 개 as a noun in Korean means “a dog”, but when used as a counter, it counts things and objects
- 명 is used for counting people.

one apple = 사과 한 개
two stones = 돌 두 개
five balls = 공 다섯 개
how many (things) = 몇 개

one person = 한 명
two students = 학생 두 명
three friends = 친구 세 명
how many (people) = 몇 명

note that the Korean numbers are truncated when used with counters, as earlier too.

지금 스무 명 있어요? = Are there 20 people now?

## Lesson 10

Present Progressive / -고 있어요

Present progressive:
- am/are/is -ing : Verb stem + -고 있어요 [-go i-sseo-yo]
Past progressive:
- was/were -ing : Verb stem + -고 있었어요 [-go i-sseo-sseo-yo]
Future progressive:
- will be -ing : Verb stem + -고 있을 거예요 [-go i-sseul kkeo-ye-yo]

In everyday conversations people often drop this part though.
Ex:
Instead of saying:
A: 지금 뭐 하고 있어요? - What are you doing now?
B: 공부하고 있어요. - I am studying.
Many people say:
A: 지금 뭐 해요? - What are you doing now?
B: 공부해요. - I am studying.

저는 한국어를 공부하고 있어요. = I am studying Korean.

지금 보고 있어요. = I am watching it now.
재미있어요? = Is it interesting?

일하고 있어요. = I am working.
일하고 있었어요. = I was working.

## Lesson 12

Names of months

In Korean, the names for the 12 months in a year are very simple. Just add the
word 월 [wol], which means “month”, after every corresponding sino-Korean number.

일월 = January
이월 = February
삼월 = March
사월 = April
오월 = May
유월 = June
칠월 = July
팔월 = August
구월 = September
시월 = October
십일월 = November
십이월 = December
몇월 = Which month?

For days, add the sino-Korean number to the Korean word 일 [il], which means “day”.

생일이 언제예요? [eon-je-ye-yo?] = When is your birthday?

(Not going to take note of some of the sample sentences here because this lesson is poorly done in TTMIK and Google Translate disagrees)

## Lesson 13

-도 [-do] is used to represent the meaning of “also” and “too”.

In English, the placement of the words “too”, “also”, or “as well” varies depending on the speaker. Most of the time they are added to the end of a sentence, but sometimes they can be placed in the middle or near the beginning next to the subject. In Korean, however, -도 is treated as a particle and ALWAYS follows the noun or pronoun.

저도 좋아요 = I like it, too
저도 봤어요 = I saw it, too

When the particle -도 needs to be attached to a noun or a pronoun which already has a particle behind it, -도 can replace the particle.

저도 학생이에요 = I am a student, too
오늘 일해요? = Are you working today?
오늘도 일해요? = Are you working today, too?

내일도 갈 거예요. = I will go (again) tomorrow, too.

## Lesson 14

The use of -도 [-do] but for verbs.
There are a few different ways to change a verb into its noun form, but the simplest and most common way is by adding -기 [-gi] to the verb stem. This is similar to using verbs in the
“to do [verb]” and “[verb]ing” format.

Ok this lesson went over my head, the examples are not good. Skipping.

## Lesson 15

Using -만 [-man] is one of the most widely used and basic ways of saying “only”. Simply add -만 after a noun, pronoun, or noun form (-기 [-gi]) of a verb.

이것만 살 거예요. = I will only buy this.
저만 = me only, I only
아침에는 커피만 마셔요. = I only drink coffee in the morning.
아침에만 커피를 마셔요. = I drink coffee only in the morning.
보기만 할 거예요. = I will only look (and not touch it).
왜 이것만 샀어요? = Why did you only buy this?
어제 놀기만 했어요. = I did nothing but play yesterday.
영화는 집에서만 봐요. = I watch movies only at home.

## Lesson 16

조금 = a little, a bit, a little bit
정말 = really, truly
아주 = very, quite
별로 = not really, not particularly
전혀 - not at all (nvm this one for cards atm, it has only few and bad examples)

* 조금, 아주, and 정말 can be used with any sentence, but 별로 and 전혀 can only be used with
negative sentences.

조금 비싸요. = It is a little expensive.
조금만 주세요. = Give me only a little bit.
물 조금만 주세요. = Give me only a little bit of water.
소금 조금만 주세요. = Give me only a little bit of salt.

정말 이상해요. = It is really strange.

아주 맛있어요. = It is very delicious.
아주 멀어요. = It is very far away.

* 아주 is the most standard way of saying “very” in the written form, but more often than not,
in spoken Korean, 아주 is replaced with 정말 or 진짜.

별로 안 비싸요. = It is not so expensive.
별로 재미없어요. = It is not that interesting.

## Lesson 17

To say “can (do something)”, use -(으)ㄹ 수 있다 [-(eu)l ssu it-tta].
To say it cannot be done, -(으)ㄹ 수 없다 [-(eu)l ssu eop-tta].

잘 수 없다 [jal ssu eop-tta] - cannot sleep (long form)

-(으)ㄹ 수 없다 is the most basic way to express “cannot”, but it is not always used in spoken Korean. A more common way to say “cannot” or “to be unable to” in spoken Korean is by adding 못 before a verb.

이거 읽을 수 있어요? = Can you read this?
못 읽어요. = I cannot read it. (short form)

지금 못 만나요. = I cannot meet you now. (short form)
갈 수 없었어요 = I could not go. (long form)
잠을 못 잤어요 = I could not sleep. (short form)

Bunch of low quality examples from TTMIK skipped here :(

## Lesson 18

[object] + -을/를 [-eul/reul] (object marking particle) + 잘하다 [jal-ha-da]
= to do [object] well; to be good at [object]

[object] + -을/를 + 못하다 [mo-ta-da]
= to do [object] poorly; to be bad at [object]

노래 = singing; song
저는 노래를 잘 못해요. = I cannot sing well.
노래 잘해요? = Can you sing well?

요리 = cooking
요리 잘해요? = Can you cook well?

## Lesson 19

Making verbs into nouns

In Level 2 Lesson 14, you learned how to add the meaning of “also” in Korean by adding -도[-do] to a verb. In order to do this, however, the verb needs to be changed into its noun form by adding -기[-gi] to the verb stem, then add -도, and end with 하다[ha-da]. (Is it all coming back to you now?)

In this lesson, you will expand that knowledge by looking at a more general way of making action verbs into nouns. Understanding this will help your understanding of how to form a number of expressions in Korean.

-는 것

This is the most general way of changing an action verb into a noun. 것 originally means “a thing”, “an object”, or “stuff”, but when it is used in this way, it can also mean “a
fact” or “an act”.

Construction:
- Verb stem + -는 것[-neun geot]

This is for use in present tense, past and future will look different.

By changing verbs into nouns, the form [verb stem + -는 것] can take many different meanings:

1. “doing” something
2. the act of “doing” something
3. the thing which one “does”
4. what one “does”
5. the fact that one is “doing” or “does” something

-는 것 is the standard form, but often at times the form -는 거 [-neun geo] is used because it is easier to pronounce. It is not, however, ever used in very formal situations.

듣다 = to listen
지금 듣는 것은 노래예요 = What I am listening to now is a song

매운 것 잘 먹어요? = Are you good at eating spicy foods?

(Don't really understand this section either too well...)

## Lesson 20

Have to, Should, Must / -아/어/여야 되다/하다

Conjugation:
1. verb stems ending in vowels ㅏ or ㅗ + -아야 되다/하다
2. verb stems ending in other vowels + -어야 되다/하다
3. 하 + -여야 되다/하다

Q: What is the difference between 하다 and 되다 here?
A: The only difference is that using 되다 is more common in colloquial situations.

집에 가야 돼요. = I have to go home.
저는 뭐 해야 돼요? = What should I do?
언제까지 여기에 있어야 돼요? = Until when should I be here?
어디에서 사야 돼요? = Where should I buy it?
누구한테 줘야 돼요? = Who should I give this to?
(한테 is roughly "to" or "for", and 주다 is give)

지금 뭐 하고 있어요? = What are you doing now?
숙제 = homework
숙제하고 있어요. 내일까지 해야 돼요. = I am doing my homework. I have to finish it by tomorrow.
내일 몇 시까지 해야 돼요? = By what time tomorrow do you have to do it?
내일 열시까지 해야 돼요. = I have to do it by 10 o'clock tomorrow.

Lesson 21

More.. than… / -보다 더

“more” is 더 [deo]
“than” or “compared to” is -보다 [-bo-da]

Basic construction not complicated but different from English, e.g.:

수박 = watermelon
수박은 사과보다 더 커요 = A watermelon is bigger than an apple.

* In the English sentence above, the word “than” comes BEFORE “apple”, but in Korean, the
word -보다 (which means “than”) comes AFTER 사과, which means “apple”.

이거보다 더 커요 = It is bigger than this.

오늘은 어제보다 더워요 = Today is hotter than yesterday.

* 더 is not always necessary in Korean. Saying “she is busy than me” instead of “she is busier than me” in English is a bit weird, but in Korean, the meaning is perfectly clear even without the word 더.

영어 = English
어려운 = difficult
영어는 한국어보다 어려워요. = English is more difficult than Korean.

저는 책을 읽는 것보다 사는 것을 더 좋아해요 = I like buying books more than reading books.
(everything prefers to read this as "I prefer living than reading books" by default but GPT-4 says that both are okay, once it's confronted about it)

손님 = customer
많다 = many
어제보다 오늘 손님이 더 많았어요 = There were more customers today than yesterday.
literally this is: yesterday than today customers more many were 

## Lesson 22

A verb which is often encountered in Korean is 좋다, which generally means “to be good”. However, there are a few instances where 좋다 [jo-ta] takes on the meaning of “to like”.

한국어 좋아요 = I like Korean language

가수 = singer
이 가수가 좋아요 = I like this singer
* the sentence 이 가수를 좋아요 would be incorrect because 좋다 is a descriptive verb and cannot have an object.
이 가수를 좋아해요 - I like this singer
* here, 좋아하다 is an action verb which means “to like” and can have an object.

저는 우유를 안 좋아해요 = I don’t like milk
한국 영화 좋아하세요? = Do you like Korean movies?

## Lesson 23

 If, In case / 만약, -(으)면
 Need to know two expressions:

 만약 - in case, if
-(으)면 - verb ending for “if”

Conjugation:
1 Verb stems ending with a vowel + -면
Ex) 자다 [ja-da] --> 자면 [ja-myeon] (if you sleep)
2 Verb stems ending with ㄹ + -면
Ex) 길다 [gil-da] --> 길면 [gil-myeon] (if it is long)
3 Verb stems ending with consonants other than ㄹ + -으면
Ex) 작다 [jak-tta] --> 작으면 [ja-geu-myeon] (if it is small)

To make the sentence clearer, add the word 만약 in front of the verb or at the beginning of the phrase. Since most Korean sentences are heavily affected by verb endings toward the end of sentences, adding 만약 at the beginning makes it easier to understand that the sentence will be conditional. If what you are saying is simple and the sentence is not very long, you do not always have to use the word 만약 in each sentence.

만약 지금 자면 = if I sleep now

밤 = night
만약 내일 밤에 비가 오면 = if it rains tomorrow night
내일 비가 오면, 집에 있을 거예요 = If it rains tomorrow, I will be at home.
리모컨을 찾으면, TV를 볼 수 있어요 = If you find the remote control, you can watch TV.

I couldn't pick too many good examples in this lesson. Not sure why TTMIK always introduces new vocabulary together with new concepts.

TODO more examples here find or generate

Also unrelated and random adding:
뭐 마실래요? = What do you want to drink?
(The "-ㄹ래" (-lae) part is a casual question ending in Korean. It is commonly used to make suggestions or invitations in a casual or familiar context. When attached to a verb stem, it expresses the idea of asking someone's preference or willingness to do something.)

## Lesson 24

아직 means “still” and “not yet”.

In English, generally, the word “still” is used with positive sentences, and the word “yet” is more
commonly used with negative sentences. However, in Korean, the word 아직 [a-jik] is used for both positive and negative sentences.

아직 열시예요. = It is still 10 o’clock.
아직 안 했어요 = I haven’t done it yet.
아직 아침이에요 = It is still morning.
아직 몰라요 = I don’t know yet.

To emphasize the meaning of “still happening” or “still not happening”, add the particle
-도 [-do] after 아직 to form 아직도 [a-jik-tto]. 아직도 has a meaning of criticizing the other person or being a little bit mad or angry.

아직도 안 왔어요? = He is still not here yet? (accusing tone)

벌써 means “already”
The usage of the word 벌써 [beol-sseo] is very similar to the English word “already”. It is generally placed at the beginning of sentences, but it does not always have to be at the beginning.

벌써 세 시예요 = It is already 3 o’clock.
벌써 왔어요? = Did you already come?
벌써 끝났어요 = It is already over.

Another version of already is: 이미
When you and/or the speaker know about something already and talk about it, use 이미.
When you are just finding out about something as you speak, use 벌써. People do not always stick to this rule, but this is the basic idea. So when new information is discovered, 벌써 is used.

벌써 비가 오고 있어요 = It is already raining.
("오-" (o-) is combined with the connecting particle "고" (go) to indicate that two actions are happening in sequence.)
벌써 추워요. = It is already cold.

저는 아직 사무실이에요 = I am still at the office.
밤 = night
아직도요? 지금 밤 열시예요! = Still? It is already 10 o’clock at night!

## Lesson 25

Something, Someday, Someone, Somewhere / 누군가, 무언가, 어딘가, 언젠가

In English, when changing the adverbs “when”, “what”, “who”, or “where” to indefinite words (words with no definite meaning), the words change form and become compound words.

When - Someday
What - Something
Who - Someone
Where - Somewhere

In Korean, it is much easier to create these indefinite words. Just simply add -ㄴ가 [-(n)-ga] to the end of the word.

For example:

누구 [nu-gu] (who) - 누군가 [nu-gun-ga] (someone)
뭐 [mwo] (what) - 뭔가 [mwon-ga] ( 무언가 [mu-eon-ga]) (something)
어디 [eo-di] (where) - 어딘가 [eo-din-ga] (somewhere)
언제 [eon-je] (when) - 언젠가 [eon-jen-ga] (someday)

미국 = the US
언젠가 미국에 가고 싶어요 = I want to go to the US someday.
일본 = Japan
언젠가 일본에 갈 거예요 = I will go to Japan someday.
뭐 찾았어요? = What did you find?
뭔가 찾았어요? = Did you find something?
뭔가 이상해요. = Something is strange.
누군가 만날 거예요? = Will you meet someone?
누군가 왔어요. = Someone came.
여기 어딘가에 있어요. = It is here somewhere.
뭔가 샀어요? = Did you buy something?
여행 = travel
여행 좋아해요? = Do you like traveling?

## Lesson 26

Imperative / -(으)세요
To tell someone to do something, add -(으)세요 [-(eu)-se-yo] to the verb stem.
Conjugation
Verb stem ending in a consonant + -으세요
Verb stem ending in a vowel or the consonant ㄹ + -세요

시작하다 = to begin, to start
시작하세요 = Please begin.
오세요 = Please come.
쉬세요 = Please rest.
고르다 = to choose, to pick
고르세요 = Please choose.

Exception:
When a verb stem ends with the consonant ㄹ, drop the ㄹ and add -세요.
팔다 - to sell
파세요 = Please sell it.

공부하세요 = Study!
내일 세 시에 오세요 = Please come at 3 o’clock tomorrow.
조심하세요 = Be careful!

## Lesson 27

Please do it for me. / -아/어/여 주세요

In our previous lesson, you learned how to tell someone to do something using -(으)세요 [-(eu)-se-yo]. Although this is perfectly acceptable, there is an even more polite way to ask the same question.
Rather than adding -(으)세요 after a verb stem, add -아/어/여 [-a/eo/yeo] + 주세요 [ju-se-yo]. By adding this verb ending, the sentence has a much nicer tone and has a nuance of asking someone for a favor or asking the other person to do something “for you”.

와 주세요 = Please do me a favor and come.

가르치다 = to teach
가르쳐 주세요 = Please teach me
한국어를 가르쳐 주세요 = Please teach me Korean.
이거 봐 주세요 = Please look at this.
저랑 영화 봐 주세요 = Please watch a movie with me.

주세요 is derived from 주다, which means “to give”. By adding 주세요 after a verb, the meaning of “do it for me, please” is also added. As for -아/어/여, think of it as a “helper” to make the pronunciation a bit easier.

To speak a little less formally, say 줘요 rather than 주세요. It is more casual than 주세요 but more polite than just -세요.

도와주세요 = Please help me
배고파요. 김밥 사 주세요 = I am hungry. Please buy me some kimbap.
무서워요. 같이 가 주세요. = I am scared. Please go with me.

## Lesson 28

Particles For Method, Way / -(으)로

Conjugation:
Nouns ending with a consonant + -으로
Nouns ending in a vowel or the consonant “ㄹ” + -로

-(으)로 connects a noun and a verb very closely and can have various functions. -(으)로 can
mark the ingredients an object is made of, the cause of a disease or something that happened, the direction in which someone is going, or the status or identity of a person doing something.
By using -(으)로, something is used as a channel, tool, device, or a method.

오늘 택시로 왔어요? = Did you come by taxi today?
버스로 갈 거예요. = I will go by bus.
생각 = thought
저를 친구로 생각해요? = Do you think of me as a friend?
저는 TTMIK 으로 한국어 공부해요 = I study Korean with TTMIK

돌아가다 = to go back, to return
이월에 캐나다로 돌아가요? = Are you going back to Canada in February?
다시 = again
네. 그런데 다시 올 거예요 = Yes. But I will come back here again.

그럼더 열심히 하세요 = Then, work harder.

## Lesson 30

Don’t do it. / -지 마세요
말다 [mal-da] - to quit doing; to not do; to stop doing

When using -(으)세요 with this word, it becomes 마세요 [ma-se-yo]. When combining 마세요 with other verbs to say “do not do” or “stop doing” something, the suffix -지 [-ji] is needed after the verb stem.

Conjugation:
Verb stem + -지 마세요

가지 마세요. = Do not go.
아직 가지 마세요 = Do not go yet.
하지 마세요 = Do not do it.
사지 마세요 = Do not buy it.
웃다 = to laugh
웃지 마세요 = Do not laugh.

Conjugation/usage note:
VERB + -시- + -아/어/여요? - Do you VERB? (honorific)
* When -시- is combined with -아/어/여요, it becomes -셔요. 
Over time however, it changed to -세요 because it is easier to pronounce.
Ex.: 살다 + -시- + -아/어/여요? → 사세요? - Do you live? (honorific)
